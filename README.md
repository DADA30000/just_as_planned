# Just As Planned
Make all DLC free and playable in a Certain Rhythm Game.
Lightning fast Rust rewrite of https://github.com/Failzuma/JustAsPlanned (yes, 95% is vibecoded, I'm sorry, just wanted to see if Gemini 3.0 could make it faster, and well, it did, soI just didn't want to rewrite something AI did perfectly fine :P)

# How to use?
1. Download just_as_planned (Linux), or just_as_planned.exe (Windows) from releases
2. Put original `GameAssembly.dll` to the same directory as `just_as_planned` (Linux) or `just_as_planned.exe` (Windows) (Take the original `GameAssembly.dll` from Muse Dash directory)
3. Then run `./just_as_planned` on Linux, or just double-click `just_as_planned.exe` on Windows
4. Wait 1-2 seconds until it generated `GameAssembly_patched.dll`
5. Put `GameAssembly_patched.dll` to your Muse Dash directory and rename it to `GameAssembly.dll`

also please star me and author of original thing, thanks :)
